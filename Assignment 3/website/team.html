	<li>1.3 Team Profile
		<ul>
		<li>Our Group or team J is made up of 6 members, we have a variety of backgrounds, educational levels and industry experience. We have variety of IT disciplines that interest us as well as different learning and personality types. The common thread that binds us together, is that we are all interested in technology in one form or another and we are all pursuing further academics and professional experience and qualifications. Working in a group is always challenging until you find your groove, and personality types need to be considered. Don Vu is an aural learner good at listening, he is neither to introverted or extraverted and tends to be agreeable. He is observant and not to judgmental, which makes him a good fit as team leader. James Eland is a little on the introverted side but is agreeable and conscience with are good team attributes. Jonathan Hazell is a hand on person and tends to be introverted but negotiable. James Parker tends to be extroverted and very agreeable, prefect for selling our product. Stefan Siotos is observant and a thinker, a little turbulent but keeps everyone on their toes. Jordan Uhe is agreeable and imaginative. So, in general our group was a good mix of personality types with no excesses in any direction, this led to smooth and effective dialogue. Educational wise we were at a variety of stages, some of us either starting a degree or had completed several years towards a Diploma. Don Vu has several IT certificates, Azure Web Services, CCNA, and MSCA. Work experience and IT experience was important in delegating various portions of the project to group members. Stefan Siotos has experience with software development at a vet important when developing a software app, James Parker is experienced in social media marketing, Jonathan Hazell has 20 years as Linux Systems Engineer, and Don Vu has multiple years’ experience as an IT Administrator. Each person’s experience was helpful in assigning them a role to in our project. As for future employment, everyone was interested in pursuing a technology related job, which was to be expected. All jobs related to Cloud infrastructure in some form or another if not directly. Don Vu is interested in IT Service manager position, a position that demands a wide range of skills. James Eland is interested in a position as an IT Analyst, James Parker is interested in being a Project Manager and implementing vendor applications. Jonathan Hazell is looking at a job as a Linux Engineer, which fits in with mot of his work history. Stefan Siotos is interested in Machine learning and Jordan Uhe’s desired job is Cloud Operations Manager. Looking at the psychological profiles that each member did, you can see a correlation between the results and their job interests. Working together as a group is not easy mainly due to personality differences and experience. Group J was comprised of individuals that where mostly middle ground, did not fall to either extreme and where mostly agreeable, conscience and had a desire to see our project comes to completion. We each had experience in some form of technology so parts could be given to each member. As the project progressed group members became much more active and participated more. In the end we formed a very cohesive group that participated well.

	<li>1.4 Group Process
		<ul>
		<li>The group worked relatively well in Assignment 2, our meeting schedule was designed in a way that would allow each member to actively participate in the course lecture and tutorials and also have time to attend the meeting. As a result, we kept the same meeting schedule.
		<li>The group meets twice a week (mainly Mondays and Saturdays) our main form of communication is Team’s video call which occurs twice a week. During the week if we need any additional support or questions answered, we can contact each other via email or Team’s messaging. 
		<li>The process for workload in the group is kept the same. The group goes through the assignment together on the first meeting, clarifying issues and uncertainties. The group then decides which parts they would like to do or which parts suits a member best, the part or parts is then allocated to that member and is expected to have it done by the agreed date.
		<li>During the teaching period, members can ask each other for help and if others are willing, they can assist. If not, the group will come together and work through that part together to accomplish that section.
