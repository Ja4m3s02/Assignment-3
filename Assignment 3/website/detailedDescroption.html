 <li><strong>4 Detailed Description</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>4.1 Aims
		<ul>
		<li>The specific aim for the project is to.” Unite people with updated information”. This aim will allow people to have the most updated information on their chosen websites and have people be able to be informed wherever they may be. The aim of uniting people with the most updated information will get people to know what is happening around the world or what is happening in a certain hobby or whatever the case maybe, in which people can get more knowledge of it a lot easier.
		<li>The first goal is “Find the trends”. By finding the trends of something. For example, shoes. If we are able to find what is trending and what people are talking about in the shoe industry. Then we are able to access what is happening and be able to created the technology that will help benefit for the shoe industry and find the best solution possible for all the people who want to either buy or read information about a certain shoe. This goal is expected to be one of the main priorities of creating this chrome extension. This will give us information on how we are able to create the extension and be able to use the known information and use it for different industries and people are interested in.
		<li>The second goal is “Create the extension”. This goal will lead us into creating the extension. It will allow us to actually start on creating the chrome extension and be able to experiment with different areas of the chrome extension. For example, creating a user-friendly UI and how the code works for the chrome extension.
		<li>The third goal is “Link the user and extension”. This just simply means to be able to create a link between the user and the website. In which it could be through email, text message or a web-alert. This will then create a link from the user and the desired website that they have chosen to get this notification and inform them where the change has happened. By creating this link between the user and the chrome extension, it will then get the user to use the extension for other websites and be able to get even more information that they would like to get.
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>4.2 What are the most important parts of the project?
		<ul>
		<li>The most important part of the project is to be able to be able to create a link between the user and their chosen websites. This is really important because of the fact that the user needs to get notified that a change in a website has in fact occurred. With no form of being able to link the user and the website then the user will not be able to know when something has changed. This will then make the chrome extension obsolete and pointless.
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>4.3 Which parts should have priority over the others
		<ul>
		<li>Creating the extension is the top priority of the project is creating the chrome extension. The team should dedicate most of their time to the creation of the extension itself. This is because that without creating a good quality chrome extension then people will not use it and will use other chrome extensions. By having the chrome extension completed and ready-to-use, consumers will then come to our project and use it because of the fact that it is completed and has been the team’s main priority
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<br />
<li><strong>5 Plans & Progress</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>5.1 How the project begain
		<ul>
		<li>The project began as a university assignment where 6 individuals were tasked with creating or developing an IT project. The group decided on the plan to develop a Chrome Application In which it allows users to track websites of any changes and if there are changes, alerts the users via email, text message or SMS.
		<li>The idea seems achievable at that time and was one of the major underlining factors in selecting this for the assignment theme. As we progressed through there was many constraints from knowledge, skills, teamwork, time and to financial commitments. As we submitted our assignment 2 for this unit, the idea was more achievable once we had done some research. As a result, the continuation of the developing application to become an active live application in which users can subscribe or purchase.
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>5.2 What your project will do?
		<ul>
		<li>The project aims to target a certain niche in the market. Groups such as bargain hunters and collectors where they need to continuously search for deals or items that are in high demand. This will help these collectors or hunters to be notified when these items are available or have changed status.   We aim to develop this project into a working solution to meet market demands from a user’s perspective. There are many options out there, but they are predominately checking if the website is live or not by performing routine pings to the website address.   
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>5.3 How will you do it?
		<ul>
		<li>The project is in its development stage right now. The group aims to have at least the development, staffing, backbone, features, UI (rough ins) available for investor considerations. Once all components are carefully considered and identified all the “what’s” and “how’s” we will need to go out and seek potential investors to assist us in funding the project. The project requires funding as there is certain skill sets, we do not possess in the group. We require funding to build the physical backbone of the application as well. Things such as servers, licencing, computer to host etc… 
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>5.4 How has it progressed
		<ul>
		<li>5.4.1 Development
			<ul>
			<li>Overall, the development of the project has progressed smoothly. As all projects there were bumps and dead ends at the start but the overall result has been achieving results. Development is always the hardest part in creating a project; there are so many ideas and different avenues in which the project can develop. Luckly, the decision in the group was unified in the very early stages and the end goal was clearly defined. Currently the group has been able to design the basic concept of the backbone infrastructure. Using Linux as the core, the CTO with his years of experience and knowledge will be the lead for this development and implementation. 
			<li>The UI will be managed by our development manager Stefan who will decide on the development team and how the team should be housed. Whether the project will be completed with UI developers in house or be up for tendering by external contractors. 
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.2 Staffing
			<ul>
			<li>Staffing levels are currently very limited, as it consists of the members currently involved in the initial project. 
				<ul>
				<li>Don Vu as the CEO
				<li>James Parker as the CMO
				<li>Johnathan Hazel as the CTO
				<li>James Eland and Jordan Uhe as the developer
				</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The backbone of the project is designed to operate on Linux platform with a SQL database. Hardware requirement are minimal, so the requirement for powerful hardware is not required. The application can operate and be hosted on a medium specification computer built as a server. More detailed information regarding this setup can be found in the Tools section.
			<li>The idea is that the group will develop and plan as much as practical and the remainder of the work will either be outsourced to tender or addition resources will be hired to complete the tasks.
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.3 Backbone
			<ul>
			<li>The backbone of the project is designed to operate on Linux platform with a SQL database. Hardware requirement are minimal, so the requirement for powerful hardware is not required. The application can operate and be hosted on a medium specification computer built as a server. More detailed information regarding this setup can be found in the Tools section.
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.4 Features
			<ul>
			<li>Features of the application will be allowing users to take a snapshot of the webpage they wish to monitor. The application will notify the user when the website has an update, whether it be price, quantity or availability
			<li>The user can subscribe to more premium services to monitor more webpages and specifics of the webpage. This premium subscription can be broken up into Tier one, Tier two, Tier three and Tier four, and the duration of the subscription can be from One month, Three month, Six months, One year.
			<li>The monetary tag has yet to be determine and will be evaluated on the amount of features the application can present to the user. Once we are able to determine this, most likely in the UAT phase; we will then determine the pricing for each Tier/Month. 
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.5 UI
			<ul>
			<li>The UI is the most important part of the developing stage, it needs to be simple, user friendly and efficient for the user. 
			<li>The UI is going to be straight forward and effective as to what each feature does. It needs to provide easy access to self helps or the support team for assistance. 
			<li>The specifics of the UI are still being developed and the group hopes to have it done before the presentation to potential stakeholders. This way the stakeholders can have a visual knowledge of what to expect in from this project. 
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.6 Dead Ends
			<ul>
			<li>The restrictions we currently face is of two things, the ability to access the service/hardware and financial support. We require the financial support from our investors to further progress with the project. Up to this point, our ideas and plans have been all paper based. 
			</li>
